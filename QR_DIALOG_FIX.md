## 🔧 QR Dialog Closing Issue - FIXED!

### 🐛 **Problem:**

The QR dialog was closing immediately after clicking "Download QR" in member/minister dropdowns.

### 🔍 **Root Cause:**

When clicking the QR action inside a dropdown menu, the dropdown would close immediately, and since the QRCodeDialog was using the dropdown item as a trigger, the dialog would get unmounted before it could properly open.

### ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

1. **Modified QRAction Component** (`qr-action.tsx`):
   - Added controlled state management with `useState`
   - Added click handler that prevents event propagation
   - Separated dropdown item from QR dialog trigger

2. **Updated PersonQRCode Component** (`person-qr-code.tsx`):
   - Added optional `isOpen` and `onClose` props for controlled state
   - Maintains backward compatibility with trigger-based usage

3. **Enhanced QRCodeDialog Component** (`qr-code.tsx`):
   - Added support for controlled state via `isOpen` and `onClose` props
   - Maintains internal state management for uncontrolled usage
   - Smart state management that switches between controlled/uncontrolled modes

### 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **User clicks "Download QR"** in dropdown menu
2. **Click handler prevents** dropdown from interfering
3. **QR dialog state** is managed independently from dropdown
4. **Dialog opens properly** and stays open until user closes it

### ✅ **Result:**

- QR dialogs now open and stay open properly
- No more immediate closing issues
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Backward compatible with existing trigger-based usage

The QR code download feature now works perfectly in both member and minister tables! 🎉
