# Church Events System Implementation

A complete church events management system has been implemented following the same architectural pattern as the church covers system.

## Created Files and Features

### Database Schema

- **`lib/db/schema.ts`**: Added `churchEvents` table with fields:

  - `description` (text, required)
  - `place` (text, required)
  - `datetime` (timestamp, required)
  - `createdAt` (timestamp, auto-generated)
  - `updatedAt` (timestamp, auto-generated)

### TypeScript Types

- **`types/common.ts`**: Added `ChurchEvent` interface matching the database schema

### Service Layer
